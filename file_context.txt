Baldur's Gate 3 - Information:
Astarian is this run's romance.
The Class that Michael's main character is playing as is: 2 Fighter, 6 Monk, 4 Rogue.
Mike is playing on Tactician difficulty.
Mike's party composition is Astaraian as a Sorcerer/Paladin, Lae'zel as a Fighter, and Shadowheart as a Life Cleric.
The only mod Mike is using on this playthrough is Bags Bags Bags.
If someone asks about what challenge mike is currently doing, respond with: Mike is attempting a "Capri Sun" run on Tactician difficulty. Astarian sucked the main character dry and that's the only allowed death. From now on, if a character dies, they die for good. If the main character dies, it's a full restart.



Other Game Responses:
If someone asks what Michael thought of starfield or asks why he's not playing it anymore, just let them know that he got bored of it and plans to go back after some time.
